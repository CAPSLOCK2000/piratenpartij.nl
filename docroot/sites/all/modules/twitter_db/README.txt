*** About Twitter DB module
---------------------------------------

This module downloads all tweets from a specific Twitter account and saves them 
in the database. The block display get the tweets from database and not directly
from Twitter.
That avoid problems with Twitter rate limit that returns following message if
over 150 requests is done per hour:
"Rate limit exceeded. Clients may not make more than 150 requests per hour."
